## A little bit about Calicobot

Calicobot is what I consider to be my first real pet project. It all started very modestly as a small self-learning freeform task of creating a little chatbot prototype to apply my fresh knowledge of very simple programming concepts in Python, such as conditions and loops.

I eventually started adding little games such as tic-tac-toe to it as I slowly learned more about Python and programming, and it naturally started to become my go-to project to improve upon learning new things.

I have since then tried to conceive new, more “useful” projects to show (and apply) my growing skills in programming, but I never got attached to any of them like I got attached to Calicobot (making it a cat probably helped with that), which I kept missing and remembering fondly as my little modest pet project. Upon realization of this, I have decided I wanted to make Calicobot some justice and fully embrace the attachment I developed for it, by making it a goal to develop a Calicobot application where it can make other people fall in love with its simplicity and cuteness in a productive way. So this is where I stand right now, at the start of this race: I just created a GitHub account for the purpose of hosting Calicobot's code from this moment onwards.

And where will that lead us from here? Nobody really knows. I have a little goal stuck at the back of my head, but at the moment it sounds like a very far away dream. It is very possible that we will never see Calicobot become an app, even. But having a goal to look forward to will definitely help us choose a path for it and, even if it never reaches close to my ambitions, I am more than satisfied with just learning with the process and hang out with Calicobot some more.

So; do you want to stick around and watch Calicobot grow?
